#Strategies

*c4_v440.lp*
 
- In this ASP-file a beginning has been made to define a strategy. The idea of this strategy is to complete a row of four when there are 3 discs already in line with one open cell.  
- Lines 212-end is the original program (not yet a version learned by ILASP).
- Lines 184-210 define cells that can be used to win a game, also called 'threats'. Testing these rules is not yet finished. 
- Line 206 shows an optimisation, so for the player in control the best move is presented if this strategy is an option.
